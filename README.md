# Google-speech-to-text Visualizer

This is a very simple visualizer for Google speech-to-text transcripts.

We found that the raw json format was too complexe to use by most humans who just needed to copy part of it.

The visualizer is available [online](https://teamstarter.github.io/google-speech-to-text-visualizer/).

It runs entierly in your browser and do not share any of the data you are providing.
